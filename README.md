# Event Management API

A Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL-based REST API using Prisma ORM to manage events and registrations.

## API Description

The Event Management API provides endpoints for creating, reading, and managing events and user registrations. Built using Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and Prisma, this API enables event organizers to easily create events, register users, and view event details.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (or yarn)
- PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UjjwalTomar0808/event-management.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd event-management
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Database Setup

This project uses Prisma for database management.

1. Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database running.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your database connection string:

    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
    ```

3. Run the database migrations:

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the application in development mode (with hot-reloading):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you configure).

## Folder Structure

The project follows a standard Node.js project structure:

```

├── prisma/
│   ├── migrations/
│   └── schema.prisma
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── controller/
│   ├── database/

```

- `prisma/`: Contains all files related to the Prisma ORM, including the database schema (`schema.prisma`) and migration history.
- `public/`: Can be used to store static files.
- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the application.
  - `config/`: For application configuration files.
  - `controller/`: Contains the route handlers (controllers) that process incoming requests.
  - `database/`: For database connection and setup.
  - `middleware/`: For Express middleware functions.
  - `routes/`: Defines the API routes.
  - `schema/`: Contains validation schemas (e.g., for request bodies).
  - `service/`: Can be used for business logic, separating it from the controllers.
  - `utils/`: For utility functions and classes.
- `app.log`: Log file for the application.
- `nodemon.json`: Configuration for nodemon.
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler options.

## API Workflow

The typical workflow for using this API is as follows:

1. **Create an Event**: An event is created first. This can be done by sending a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/events` endpoint.
2. **Create a User**: A user is created by sending a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/auth` endpoint.
3. **Register User for Event**: Once you have an event and a user, you can register the user for the event. This is done by sending a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/events/:eventId/register` endpoint, where `:eventId` is the ID of the event. The user's ID should be included in the request body.
